## What this project is about
Meditation and kids might not sound like a match made in heaven. Kids between the ages of ten to fourteen lead busy and active lives, it’s a time of fast transition and emotional & cognitive development. Where can they get some rest and some quiet time will all of that buzzing? Ohmmmm is a game that makes meditation fun and engages kids to slow down and relax.

## Technologies used

The front-end framework was developed using `React` and `Redux`.<br />
The game was built using `Phaser 3` and the back-end was implemented with `Express`

## Game Rules

Move the flower across the screen while trying to collect ohmmmms.<br />
Move too fast and you will lose points.<br />
When you move too fast you will be alerted via warning text.<br />
Try and match your breathing to the flower pulse.<br />
The goal is to relax and take your time and not rush to collect points.

## Run Locally

The `Server` is deployed to Heroku. <br />
If all dynos are running, you only need to run the `Client`

```sh
cd client/
npm install
npm run start
```

## Our agile workflow and Trello board

We try to maintain a backlog to keep track of all implemented and future features. That way people can quickly jump in and start helping out. It also displays how we split up our tasks and try to build this project in an iterative and incremental way!
